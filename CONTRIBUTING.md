# 🙌 Contributing to hechi

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the hechi project!

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

- All Pull Requests (PRs) must be submitted to the **`dev` branch**.
- Work should always be done on a **feature branch** created from your **personal fork**.
- Please follow the naming convention:
  - `feature/<feature-name>` for new features
  - `fix/<bug-description>` for bug fixes
- Commit messages should be clear and consistent.
  - Example: `feat: add encryption feature`, `fix: memory leak issue`

## 🛠️ Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. Create a new `feature/` branch from the latest `dev` branch.
3. Implement your changes, commit, and push them to your fork.
4. Open a Pull Request targeting the `dev` branch of the hechi repository.
5. Wait for review and approval.

## 📦 Code Style Guidelines

- Write clean, concise, and readable code.
- Add comments when necessary to clarify complex logic or intentions.

## 🔀 Pull Request Merge Strategy

- We **only use "Squash and Merge"** for merging pull requests.
- When a pull request is merged, all commits will be squashed into a single commit.
- Please ensure your PR title clearly describes the changes, as it will become the final commit message.

_Reason:_  
Squash merging keeps the `dev` and `main` branches clean and makes it easier to track individual changes through the project history.

## 📣 Additional Notes

- Even for documentation updates (e.g., README), please submit changes via a Pull Request.
- All contributions will go through a review process and may require revisions before being merged.
